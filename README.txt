How to run my code for assignment one.

1. Download the code from github at the following URL: https://github.com/funkjo/Randomized-Optimization

2. Navigate to the working directory: Randomized-Optimization/

3. Create an Anaconda environment or create a virtual environment. The Python version is preferably 3.8 or later

4. Run the command conda install --file requirements.txt for an Anaconda environment or run the command pip install requirements.txt

5. There are two notebooks, ROExperiments.ipynb and NNOptimization.ipynb. The first notebook runs the four optimization algorithms on three optimization problems. The second applys the optimization algorithms to the neural network structure from last assignment.

6. Please reach out to my Georgia Tech email if there are any issues.
